# 1. Foundations

## Tree shakes

- We need to understand our role in broad outcomes
- We need to check our priors and conventional wisdom
- We need to learn how to look with a critcal eye
- We should try to keep the user and their needs in mind and balance it against our own requirements

## Web Tech Foundations

- 5 pillar model
  - Purpose: content and function
  - Structure: architecture
  - Execution: coding
  - Distribution: hosting
  - Form: Visuals and Layout
- Setting our priority of Constituencies
  - need for theoretical purity
  - technical platform needs
  - developer needs
  - user needs

## Web Request Response Introduction

- Network Confusion: Local or Remote
  - The client server model seems like it always includes a network, but sometimes that network varies quite a bit to the point of being non-consequential.
  - Example: Localhost Effect
    - You have a browser on your laptop and you are talking to a server on your laptop
  - Question: What would the perception over time of diving on our localhost for us as developers?
- Localhost Effects
  - The localhost and your environment (browser, screen, CPU) and thought process as a user is everyone is a terrible outcome of the local dev situation that results in many of the problems you will observe online
  - Harsh truths
    - You are not the user
    - your awareness of tech is generally greater than your users
    - you sipmly don't have a realistic view of what the real world is like from localhost
    - your end users don't necessarily know what you have built
  - Solution: go out and start experiencing what is happening online and look closely
- Client-Server Model
  - The web is currently dominated by a client-server model
  - client generally is a web browser and it request data from server(s) to then present to users
  - Discussion point: certainly this model would change with decentralization, but are we confusing the problem. Is this really an issue of client/server and centralization or with consolidation
- Client-Server Technical Dimensions
  1. Client Side
     - We can distinguish the amount of "work" done here
     - We can distinguish the type of client involved
  2. Server Side
     - We can distinguish the amount of "work" done here
     - We can distinguish the way the work is performed
  3. Network
     - The type of network connectivity between client and server does matter and characterizes the nature of the web site or app as shown next
